                <h1 id="using-the-repl">Using the REPL</h1>
<p>Once the REPL is started, simply connect to it with your SSH client.
The foundation of cau-repl is Groovy's <code>groovysh</code>, so for the very basics you can refer to
the <a href="https://groovy-lang.org/groovysh.html">groovysh Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The general idea behind the REPL is that you can enter Groovy code, which is immediately executed in the same JVM as
your target application. The results of your invocation are displayed to you after every single command and can be
further modified with the next command you enter. This concept is known as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">Read-Eval-Print Loop</a> (REPL). All the classes the
application uses internally are available to you, enriching it with full scripting capabilities.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="basic-operation">Basic Operation</h2>
<p>Apart from the normal Groovy syntax, the REPL provides a number of built-in commands. See the
<a href="https://groovy-lang.org/groovysh.html#GroovyShell-RecognizedCommands">groovysh Command List</a>. We will only focus on cau-repl specific additions in the following.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="editing-files">Editing Files</h2>
<p>When you enter longer blocks of code - such as functions or loops - it is convenient to use a full-featured editor.
cau-repl provides two commands for this.
As a prerequisite, a suitable terminal-based editor must be installed on the system running cau-repl. By default,
<code>vim</code> is configured. <strong>If you configure a different editor, make sure that it supports running without a TTY.</strong> Not all
editor have this capability.</p>
<p><strong>Edit and evaluate a file</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:editssh [filename]</code><br/>
<code>:E [filename]</code></p>
<p>Opens an existing or new file named <code>filename</code> in an editor and immediately evaluates its content after returning to the REPL.</p>
<p><strong>Positional Parameters</strong></p>
<p><code>String filename</code> <em>optional</em> - The name of the file to open</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> the return value of the last statement in the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit a file without evaluating it</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:editfilessh [filename]</code><br/>
<code>:EF [filename]</code></p>
<p>Opens an existing or new file named <code>filename</code> in an editor without evaluating it in the REPL.</p>
<p><strong>Positional Parameters</strong></p>
<p><code>String filename</code> <em>optional</em> - The name of the file to open</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-text"># invocation without a filename parameter
# creates a temporary one-off file that is automatically deleted after evaluation
groovy:000&gt; :E

# most convenient: invocation with a simple name - no path and no extension
# creates / opens a persistent file named e.g. editbuffer-1.groovy in the REPL's workdir
groovy:000&gt; :E 1

# invocation with a full path creates / opens exactly this file
groovy:000&gt; :E /tmp/foo.groovy
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
<p>The REPL has built-in logging functions that will make use of Log4J if it is installed, but also work without it.</p>
<p><strong>Log a message</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function</strong></p>
<p><code>trace(...msgs) / debug(...msgs) / warn(...msgs) / error(...msgs)</code></p>
<p>Logs the given message to suitable logging systems with the log-level corresponding to the method name.</p>
<p><strong>Positional Parameters</strong>
- <code>String msgs</code> <em>repeatable</em> - The objects that will be logged after invoking their <code>.toString()</code> method. The first
  instance of this parameter is special in that it can contain <code>{}</code> placeholders. These will be replaced with the
  text representation of each succeeding further parameter. Excess parameters will be joined with a newline.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Named Parameters</strong>
- <code>ReplLog.LOG_TARGETS[] targets = REPLLog.DEFAULT_LOG_TARGETS</code> - The list of targets that will receive this message.
  See the <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLLog.html">REPLLog</a> documentation for possible values.
  If omitted, the message will be logged to Log4J if it is available or stderr if
  not. In addition, it will be written to the REPL's own logfile in its work directory.
- <code>PrintStream[] streams = []</code> - A list of multiple <code>PrintStream</code> that will receive this message. Empty by default.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> The <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLLogEntry.html">REPLLogEntry</a> that was logged</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Retrieve the REPL log file</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function</strong></p>
<p><code>repllog()</code></p>
<p>Retrieves the contents of the REPL's internal log file, which is rotated every time
the target application starts up.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> a list of <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLLogEntry.html">REPLLogEntry</a> in chronological order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Retrieve the Tomcat log</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function</strong></p>
<p><code>tomcatlog()</code></p>
<p>Retrieves the contents of Tomcat's main <code>catalina.out</code> log file. This will only be successful, if you use Tomcat with
a standard logging setup.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> an array of <code>String</code>, in chronological order.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// log a formatted message to sensible default targets

<hr />
<h2 id="job-management">Job Management</h2>
<p>You can start long-running jobs in the REPL that will execute in the background and continue running after you end the
SSH session. Jobs can be associated with a list of inputs to be processed. If you can list your inputs in advance,
cau-repl can automatically parallelize your jobs. This also makes it possible to re-run just the inputs that failed later
on, even after restarting the target application.</p>
<p><a name="job"></a><strong>Create a new job</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function</strong></p>
<p><code>job(closure)</code></p>
<p>Run the Groovy <code>Closure</code> closure in the background. You can optionally pass a list of input work items, which is then
subsequently processed, tracking the job's progress in a file in the REPL's work
directory. This makes it possible for you to resume aborted or failed executions as well as inspect the job's results
even after restarting the target application. Jobs instances that throw an exception will be considered failed.
Instances that do not throw an exception will be considered successful.<br/>
MyCoRe users should use the <a href="../mycore/#mcrjob">mcrjob()</a> function instead,
which is additionally integrated with MyCoRe's job system.</p>
<p><strong>Positional Parameters</strong></p>
<p><code>Closure closure</code> - The Groovy Closure to execute. If you do not specify the named parameter <code>inputs</code>, pass a closure
that does not require any parameters (<code>{ -&gt; foo() }</code>). If you do specify <code>inputs</code>, pass a closure that accepts two
parameters (<code>{ x, j -&gt; foo(x) }</code>). cau-repl will pass the current input in the first parameter and the job that it
belongs to in the second parameter.<br/>
The return value of the closure is considered the result of the job for the current input item.
Return values' class must implement the <code>Serializable</code> interface, so cau-repl can persist your output. The
results of each invocation of the closure are kept in memory, so
design your jobs to return only small data structures. If you need to generate larger structures, you should persist
them somewhere else yourself and only return a status code here.<br/>
The <code>ReplJob</code> that is created by this call will by default be set as the closure's
<a href="https://groovy-lang.org/closures.html#_delegation_strategy">delegate</a>, providing variants of the logging methods
<code>info()</code> and so forth. This will cause your log messages to additionally be persisted in the job's state file, so you
can review them via the <code>ReplJob.jobLog()</code> method.<br/>
To signal a failure, throw any exception.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Named Parameters</strong></p>
<p><code>Boolean autostart = true</code> - Controls whether your job should immediately be started or placed in the master job list
in a paused state.</p>
<p><code>Integer autotune</code> <em>experimental</em> - If set, enables automatic parallelization for the processing of your input items.
cau-repl will measure the throughput of work items and optimize the degree of parallelism on-the-fly. This works best
when your work items are homogenous and individual processing time is small. The number you specify here is the
maximum degree of parallelism you will allow. <em>Note:</em> to use a fixed number of parallel worker threads, just specify
the <code>concurrency</code> parameter (see below) and don't set <code>autotune</code>.</p>
<p><code>Boolean background = true</code> - Controls whether this call should return immediately, or only after the job has finished
running. You might want to disable background processing when you also enable progress messages.</p>
<p><code>Boolean becomedelegate = true</code> - Controls whether cau-repl will set the newly created <code>ReplJob</code> as your closure's
delegate before executing it. This makes the instance methods of your <code>ReplJob</code> (especially the versions of the
logging methods <code>info()</code>, etc. that also log to your job's private log) readily available for your closure. 
More information is available in
<a href="https://groovy-lang.org/closures.html#_delegation_strategy">Groovy's closure documentation</a>. </p>
<p><code>int concurrency = 1</code> - Spawn this many worker threads and process inputs in parallel. You can also change the concurrency
level of a job while it is running. If you also pass the <code>autotune</code> parameter,
the value of <code>concurrency</code> will be used as the initial concurrency level to start the tuning-process from.</p>
<p><code>Boolean errorpause = false</code> - If set, the job will be paused on the first error (i.e. when your closure throws an
exception). If there are other parallel workers, the work items they are currently processing will not be aborted and
your job will be fully paused after they too have finished their current work items.</p>
<p><code>Collection&lt;Serializable&gt; inputs</code> - The work items that will be sequentially - in the order you specified them -
passed as the first parameter to subsequent executions of your closure. The entire list will be kept in memory, so
only use small objects here. To process larger objects, pass their ids or addresses instead and fetch them yourself
from your closure. If you omit this parameter, your closure will simply be called once without input arguments.</p>
<p><code>String name = &lt;job's key&gt;</code> - Set a descriptive name for your job to make identifying it easier. If omitted, your job's
auto-generated key will also be used as its name.</p>
<p><code>Boolean progress = false</code> - Log job progress to the REPL periodically. Best combined with <code>background = false</code>.</p>
<p><code>String resume</code> - Pass the <code>key</code> of a finished ReplJob here to resume it. When you resume a job, your
new job's state will be initialized from the persistent state file of the old job in the REPL's work directory.
This includes inputs, results as well as its internal log.
By default, only inputs that were not successfully processed (i.e. inputs that have failed, never started or started and
did not finish at all) will be processed when you start the new job. Do not pass the <code>inputs</code> parameter when you
resume - input values will automatically be read from the old job's state file.</p>
<p><code>Boolean retryerror = true</code> - When resuming a job, disable to not retry inputs that threw an exception.</p>
<p><code>Boolean retrysuccess = false</code> - When resuming a job, enable to also retry inputs that were successful.</p>
<p><code>ThreadFactory threadfactory</code> - Use a custom ThreadFactory to spawn the worker threads. If unspecified, the
system default is used.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> the <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLJob.html">ReplJob</a> that was created.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Retrieve a current job and print its progress</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:job [index]</code> / <code>:job [key]</code><br/>
<code>:J [index]</code> / <code>:J [key]</code></p>
<p>Retrieves the ReplJob that has the given <code>index</code> number in the <code>:J</code> listing, or whose <code>key</code> matches the argument.
Print its JobProgress to the console and return the job object.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> The <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLJob.html">ReplJob</a> that was requested.
<strong>Pause or unpause a job</strong>
<strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:job pause [key]</code> / <code>:job unpause [key]</code><br/>
<code>:J pause [key]</code> / <code>:J unpause [key]</code><br/></p>
<p>Pauses the job with the given <code>key</code>. When paused, workers will finish their currently assigned work item, but will not
receive any new work items. While residual items are still being processed, the job's state will be given as
"pausing", after which it will transition to "paused".</p>
<p>Unpausing a paused job will cause unprocessed work items to be submitted to the workers again.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> when pausing: a boolean indicating if the job transitioned to the "pausing" state (could e.g. be false for already
paused jobs); when unpausing: the number of milliseconds that the jobs has in the paused state.

<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:job cancel [key]</code> / <code>:job cancelforce [key]</code><br/>
<code>:J cancel [key]</code> / <code>:J cancelforce [key]</code><br/></p>
<p>Cancels the job with the given <code>key</code>. No further input items will be passed to the worker threads. When invoked as
<code>cancel</code>, previously active threads will be allowed to continue indefinitely until they have finished their previously
assigned inputs. During this phase, the job state will be "cancelling" after which it will transition to "cancelled".
The job is then ready for archiving or resuming it.</p>
<p>When invoked as <code>cancelforce</code>, previously active threads will be forcefully terminated after a grace period of 10s.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> a boolean indicating if the job transitioned to the "cancelling" or "cancelled" state (could e.g. be
false for jobs that finished in the meantime).</p>

<h2 id="loading-maven-artifacts">Loading Maven Artifacts</h2>
<p>You can load maven artifacts into the repl at runtime, without altering the installation of your target application.</p>
<p><strong>Load a maven artifact into the REPL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:grabrepl [group[:module[:version|*[:classifier]]]][@ext]</code><br/>
<code>:G [group[:module[:version|*[:classifier]]]][@ext]</code></p>
<p>Fetches the maven artifact described by the parameters as well as its dependencies and loads it into the REPL for this
session. Downloaded artifacts will be cached in the REPL's work directory to speed up the process in subsequent
sessions. Specifying <code>group</code>, <code>module</code> and <code>version</code> is usually sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// fetch the apache-commons numbers module for primes and load it into the repl
groovy:000&gt; :G org.apache.commons:commons-numbers-primes
// now import one of its classes
groovy:000&gt; import org.apache.commons.numbers.primes.Primes
===&gt; [...], org.apache.commons.numbers.primes.Primes
// and use it to find the prime factors of a number

<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>The REPL will normally compile your Groovy sources when the target application starts. If you want to compile code
dynamically at runtime, there is a support function available for you.</p>
<p><a name="compile"></a><strong>Compile Groovy sources</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function</strong></p>
<p><code>compile(path)</code></p>
<p>Compile the Groovy sources at the specified path and load them into a suitable classloader. MyCoRe user should use the
<a href="../mycore/#mcrcompile">mcrcompile()</a> function instead, which will use default parameter values suitable for MyCoRe.</p>
<p><strong>Positional Parameters</strong></p>
<p><code>Path | File | String path</code> - The location of the sources to compile. If you pass a directory, all <code>.groovy</code> files
below it will be compiled as one coherent unit.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Named Parameters</strong></p>
<p><code>ClassLoader classloader = &lt;REPL's classloader&gt;</code> - The ClassLoader in which the generated classed should be put. Will
default to the REPL's ClassLoader, which is subject to the settings described in the
<a href="../installation/#loading-the-agent">Installation</a> section.</p>
<p><code>String classpath = &lt;REPL's classpath&gt;</code> - The class path to use when locating targets of the @Patches annotation.
Defaults to the REPL's classpath.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> the <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/groovy/GroovySourceDirectory.html">GroovySourceDirectory</a> with the results of the compilation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Related Classes:</strong> <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/groovy/GroovySourceDirectory.html">GroovySourceDirectory</a> provides additional functionality related to compilation.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<h2 id="managing-breakpoints">Managing Breakpoints</h2>
<p>You can add breakpoints to your Groovy code. When triggered, they pause its execution and transfer control to the REPL.
See the <a href="../extending/#adding-interactive-breakpoints">Extending</a> section to start using this feature. Once you have augmented your code with breakpoints, you
can manage them in the REPL:</p>
<p><strong>List currently triggered breakpoints and disabled patterns</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:breakpoint</code><br/>
<code>:B</code></p>
<p>Lists all currently triggered breakpoints: their numeric key, function and name.
Will output a list of all currently disabled breakpoint patterns</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> the list in text format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Resume a currently triggered breakpoint</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:breakpoint [key [feedback]]</code><br/>
<code>:B [key [feedback]]</code></p>
<p>Resumes the currently triggered breakpoint with the specified <code>key</code>. You can optionally pass a feedback result, which
will be returned as the result of the <code>replbreakpoint</code> function call that triggered this breakpoint.<br/>
<em>Please Note:</em> for technical reasons, repeated whitespace characters in your feedback string will be merged into a
single space - even within quotes (which will be considered part of your feedback). If this is a problem, you should
use the <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLBreakpoint.html#resume(long)">REPLBreakpoint.resume()</a> function instead.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Disable or enable breakpoints</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:breakpoint disable [pattern]</code> / <code>:breakpoint enable [pattern]</code><br/>
<code>:B disable [pattern]</code> / <code>:B enable [pattern]</code></p>
<p>Use this to disable or re-enable certain breakpoint matching a regular-expression pattern in Java RE syntax. A
triggered breakpoint with a <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLBreakpoint.html#getSignature()">signature</a> that matches one of your disabled patterns will be silently ignored.
Your breakpoints' signatures are displayed in the <code>:B</code> breakpoint list after the numeric key (e.g.
<code>org.example.Dummy::foo - My Breakpoint</code>).<br/>
<em>Please Note:</em> for technical reasons, repeated whitespace characters in your pattern string will be merged into a
single space - even within quotes (which will be considered part of your pattern). If this is a problem, you should
use the <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLBreakpoint.html#disable(java.lang.String)">REPLBreakpoint.disable()</a> /
<a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLBreakpoint.html#enable(java.lang.String)">REPLBreakpoint.enable()</a> functions instead.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Execute code in the thread of a triggered breakpoint</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:breakpoint eval [key] [code]</code> / <code>:breakpoint eval [key]</code><br/>
<code>:B eval [key] [code]</code> / <code>:B eval [key]</code></p>
<p>You can run code in the thread of a triggered breakpoint. Just pass the <code>key</code> of the target breakpoint and the
Groovy <code>code</code> to run end it will execute. The environment executing your snippet will have the special variable <code>this</code>
and also <code>x</code> set to the REPLBreakpoint instance that triggered.</p>
<p>You know that your code has finished executed, when your breakpoint has a <code>*</code> marker in the <code>:B</code> list. You may now
retrieve the result of you code using the <code>eval [key]</code> subcommand (i.e. without a code argument).</p>
<p><em>Please Note:</em> for technical reasons, repeated whitespace characters in your code string will be merged into a
single space - even within quotes (which will be considered part of your code). If this is a problem, you should
use the <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLBreakpoint.html#eval(long,de.uni_kiel.rz.fdr.repl.REPLBreakpoint.Eval)">REPLBreakpoint.eval()</a> function instead.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> nothing when you submit code to run, or the results of your code wrapped in a
<a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLBreakpoint.EvalResult.html">REPLBreakpoint.EvalResult</a> when you retrieve the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Set the maximum number of concurrent breakpoints</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shell Command</strong></p>
<p><code>:breakpoint max [limit]</code><br/>
<code>:B max [limit]</code></p>
<p>Sets the global limit for the number of unresumed triggered breakpoint instances. The first time more than this many
instances are triggered, a warning is logged and all further breakpoints are ignored (i.e. executed without
interruption) until the total number on unresumed instances drops below this threshold.<br/>
Set this to <code>0</code> to temporarily disable all breakpoints globally.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Related Classes:</strong> <a href="../apidocs/de/uni_kiel/rz/fdr/repl/REPLBreakpoint.html">REPLBreakpoint</a> provides additional functionality related to breakpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<hr />
<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tab-completion and line history is available.</li>
<li>When you mismatch parentheses or similar syntactic structures, the REPL may enter a state where it's waiting for you
  to properly syntactically finish your statement. To get out of this state, simply enter a single line consisting of
  just <code>:c</code>.</li>
<li>The return value of your last command is always available in the special <code>_</code> variable. This is useful to continue
  using it in the next line, or if you want to save it in a more persistent properly named variable. </li>
<li>groovysh's standard <code>:edit / :e</code> command is not very useful when accessing it via SSH, because it launches the editor in
  the TTY of the server process. Use the <code>:editssh / :E</code> commands instead to edit a file directly in your
  SSH session.</li>
<li>groovysh's standard <code>:grab / :g</code> command does not use the correct classloader of the REPL. Use the <code>:grabrepl / :G</code>
  commands instead.</li>
</ul>
